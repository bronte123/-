## Bio: 

My name is Brontë Johnson and I am an undergraduate student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. I am pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science, as well as a B.A. in Journalism & Film Studies. I expect to graduate in May 2022.

My future goals include combining the technology field with the entertainment industry, creating projects that haven't yet been seen before. 

Some of my interests include: Graphic Design, web design, computer animation, voice acting / voice over work, the preforming arts, sound design, computer programming, video and digital editing, film revision and analyzation, playwriting, and storytelling.

Within the coming years, I aim to create and be apart of projects that bring together mass amounts of people, as well as harnesses the ability to have influence that expands globally.
