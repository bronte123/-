My name is Brontë Johnson and I am an undergraduate student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. I am pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science, as well as a B.A. in Journalism & Film Studies. I expect to graduate in May 2022.

My future goals include combining the technology field with the entertainment industry, creating projects that haven't yet been seen before. 

Some of my interests include: Graphic Design, web design, computer animation, voice acting / voice over work, the preforming arts, computer programming, video and digital editing, film revision and analyzation, playwriting, and storytelling.

Within the coming years, I aim to create and be apart of projects that bring together mass amounts of people, as well as harnesses the ability to have influence that expands globally.


In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
