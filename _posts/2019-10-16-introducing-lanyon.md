College is the time for growth, learning, and exploration. College is a time to start building a life of your own and get excited about the future... Yet for some of our nation’s 21 million college students, the transition into adulthood is a time of significant change and intense challenge to their emotional health and well-being.
   
Open conversation about mental illnesses is becoming increasingly discussed on college campuses. For many students, being in a completely new environment can prove to be extremely stressful, especially with the addition of sports, clubs, social activities, and academics. Many times, as one progresses throughout the year, problems begin to arise—depression, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, homesickness, substance abuse—these are all cases that occur way too often.

When it comes to mental and physical health, it is important to remain open and accepting of those who struggle. _You Matter_ is important because the idea behind the movement to promote acceptance, mindfulness, inclusion and recovery. 

No matter who you are, _You Matter_ reminds every student, individual, and person that they truly matter, and that there will always be someone to talk through hard times. 

Personally, I have always been in support for mental health advocacy, improving social issues, and encouraging inclusion on campus. I believe that when one feels as passionate about a project as this, we all have the ability to create real change, and improve the lives of those around us one step at a time.
