[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about) is widely known for their technological and creative contributions to society. With innovation and change serving as a few of its core values, Microsoft soon founded the _Council for Digital Good_, an group made up of today's youth to combat online harassment. 


  > The internet is truly the landmark invention of our lifetime, but it’s not without risk – and those risks seem to be morphing and increasing in line with the rapidly developing pace of technology. 

The Council began with the idea of learning from indiviuals from different backgrounds in attempt to develop a deeper understanding of online harassment. The process included searching through a nationwide applicant pool of youth ages 13 - 18 years old. After a long delibration period, fifteen applicants were finally invited to serve on the inaugral _Council for Digital Good_. 

The internet is highly influential and has both a national and global reach. With this in mind, the Council was purposefully structured to have members who resided from all over the country;

With a diverse and unbias group of members, the Council was able to fully understand and begin to research the problem of online bullying from various points of location.

Topics such as digital civility, online harassment, blackmail, social media, privacy, were heavily discussed at Microsoft's Headquarters in Redmond, WA, where the group had its the very first Council [summit](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/08/08/microsofts-council-for-digital-good-holds-inaugural-summit-on-improving-civility-online/).
