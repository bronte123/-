Based in an undefined time period, _The Ballad of Jebediah Jones_ is an old western themed short film. The plot opens around the main character, rugged and old-fashioned cowboy Jebediah (Jeb) Jones. Having owned a large plot of land, Jones finds himself spending an abundance of time alone, tending to his work in his barn. When word gets out around town that there has been a series of horrible murders, Jones suddenly finds himself thrust into the spotlight, suspected for being responsible for the killings.

Soon enters hard-nosed, sharp-as-a-whip southern investigator, Jayla Tillerman. Known for her wit, charm, and impressive detective work, Jayla proved to be a familiar face in the small town she lived in. Her skillset quickly earned her the title of "Town Sheriff", working to protect the very people that loved her so dearly. However, it comes as a surprise to everyone when Tillerman abruptly leaves behind the position, deciding to pursue private detective work elsewhere. But when a string of gruesome murders begins to occur in her old town, Tillerman is faced with what has the potential to become on of the biggest challenges in her career.
